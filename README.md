# Classify-Pneumonia-using-Chest-X-Rays

Data Augmentation and Visualization using X-Ray Dataset

**Brief Description:** This project involved the use of data augmentation and visualization techniques in the classification of pneumonia vs normal X-rays.

### Implementation (see notebook for each task):
* Applied data augmentation in PyTorch to improve the model's performance.
* Visualized the model's decision-making using Grad-CAM.
* Implemented lung segmentation.
* Visualized embeddings using TSNE.
